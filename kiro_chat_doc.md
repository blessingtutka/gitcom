Breaking Change Detection Implementation Analysis

### Current Implementation Status
The MessageGenerator class already contains sophisticated breaking change detection capabilities:

#### Implemented Breaking Change Detection Methods:
1. **`detectBreakingChanges(changes)`** - Main detection method
2. **`_hasExplicitBreakingChangeIndicators(change)`** - Detects explicit keywords
3. **`_hasApiBreakingChanges(change)`** - Analyzes API function/method removals
4. **`_hasVersionBreakingChanges(change)`** - Detects major version bumps
5. **`_hasBreakingDeletions(change)`** - Identifies breaking file deletions

#### Detection Capabilities:
- **Explicit Indicators**: Detects "BREAKING CHANGE", "BREAKING:", etc. in commit messages
- **API Changes**: Identifies removed functions, methods, classes, interfaces
- **Version Changes**: Detects major version bumps in package.json
- **File Deletions**: Identifies deletion of critical files (index.js, API files)
- **Function Signature Changes**: Detects parameter modifications
- **Configuration Changes**: Major config file modifications
- **Dependency Removals**: Removed dependencies in package.json

#### Test Coverage:
The test suite includes comprehensive breaking change scenarios:
- Explicit breaking change indicators
- API function removals
- Major version bumps
- Critical file deletions
