# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the GitCom extension to provide intelligent, AI-powered commit generation that can analyze code changes, automatically stage files, and create multiple structured commits that logically separate different features, fixes, and changes. The system should be smart enough to group related changes together and create meaningful commit messages following conventional commit standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to analyze all my unstaged changes and automatically group them into logical commits, so that my commit history is clean and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Generate AI Commit" THEN the system SHALL analyze all unstaged files in the repository
2. WHEN analyzing changes THEN the system SHALL group related files by feature, bug fix, or change type
3. WHEN grouping files THEN the system SHALL consider file paths, change patterns, and content relationships
4. WHEN changes are grouped THEN the system SHALL present a preview of proposed commits to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to automatically stage files and create multiple commits in the correct order, so that I don't have to manually manage staging and commit sequencing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user approves the commit plan THEN the system SHALL automatically stage files for each commit group
2. WHEN staging files THEN the system SHALL stage only the files belonging to the current commit group
3. WHEN creating commits THEN the system SHALL create them in logical dependency order (e.g., core changes before dependent changes)
4. WHEN a commit fails THEN the system SHALL stop the process and report the error to the user

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to generate intelligent commit messages that follow conventional commit format and accurately describe the changes, so that my commit history is professional and informative.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating commit messages THEN the system SHALL follow conventional commit format (type(scope): description)
2. WHEN analyzing changes THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate commit type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
3. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL detect the scope based on file paths and change patterns
4. WHEN generating descriptions THEN the system SHALL create concise but descriptive commit messages
5. WHEN changes include breaking changes THEN the system SHALL add the breaking change indicator (!)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to review and modify the proposed commits before they are created, so that I maintain control over my commit history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates a commit plan THEN the system SHALL display a preview with all proposed commits
2. WHEN displaying the preview THEN the system SHALL show the commit message, files included, and change summary for each commit
3. WHEN the user reviews the plan THEN the system SHALL allow editing commit messages
4. WHEN the user reviews the plan THEN the system SHALL allow regrouping files between commits
5. WHEN the user reviews the plan THEN the system SHALL allow excluding specific files or commits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to handle different types of changes intelligently (features, bug fixes, documentation, tests), so that commits are properly categorized and structured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing file changes THEN the system SHALL detect feature additions, bug fixes, documentation updates, and test changes
2. WHEN detecting features THEN the system SHALL group related feature files into single commits
3. WHEN detecting bug fixes THEN the system SHALL separate bug fixes from feature additions
4. WHEN detecting documentation changes THEN the system SHALL create separate documentation commits
5. WHEN detecting test changes THEN the system SHALL group test changes with their corresponding feature/fix commits when possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide feedback and progress updates during the commit generation process, so that I understand what's happening and can troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the process starts THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator with current step
2. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL display "Analyzing changes..." with file count
3. WHEN grouping commits THEN the system SHALL display "Grouping related changes..." 
4. WHEN generating messages THEN the system SHALL display "Generating commit messages..."
5. WHEN creating commits THEN the system SHALL display progress for each commit being created
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested solutions
